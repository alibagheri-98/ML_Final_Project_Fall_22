# Movie-Recommender-System

This repository contains the final project for the machine learning course instructed by Dr. Amini at Sharif University of Technology. Crafted by us, a team of teaching assistants for the machine learning course under Dr. Amini's guidance, this final project represents the culmination of our efforts. I held a leadership role among the project teaching assistants. The project's creation process involved distributing distinct research papers to each teaching assistant, tasking them with formulating questions derived from their assigned papers.

## phase 1
Consists of a collection of theoretical questions aimed at imparting fundamental knowledge about recommender systems to students

## phase 2
This phase comprises practical questions aimed at guiding the development of a movie recommender system. In phase 2, we will create a recommender system for Netflix using the algorithms taught in the course.
- K-Means and K-Nearest Neighbor
- SVM
- Matrix Factorization
- Neural Networks
- EASE (Embarrassingly Shallow Autoencoder)
- Gradient Boosting
- Tree-Based Recommendations
